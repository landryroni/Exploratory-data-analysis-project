Analysis will be done using Python3, libraries such as jovian to save, make public and share the notebook, opendatasets to download the dataset files form kaggle, pandas which is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. libraries such as matplotlib, plotly and seaborn, will be use for data visualization. geopandas, folium will be helpful to watch a geographical representation. Finaly the ineluctable numpy which is suitable when working with array.
